Total records used in analysis: 352  



NOTES ABOUT CHANGES TO USACE RESERVOIRS SHAPEFILE:

1. There are two Sardis Lakes (Vicksburg and Tulsa districts), which have been renamed Sardis Lake Vicksburg and Sardis Lake Tulsa to distinguish them from one another. 
2. Aberdeen Lake, Columbus Lake, R.E. Bob Woodruff Lake, William Dannelly Reservoir, Bay Springs Lake, Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway at Fulton, Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway at G.V. Montogmery, and Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway at Glover Wilkins in the Mobile District had repeated records that were a subset of the whole lake, and these were deleted for analysis.
3. Water Conservation Area 1, 2A, 3A, 2B, and 3B were merged into a single record: "Water Conservation Area Combined"
4. Arkport Reservoir was deleted because it is a dry dam that is only impounded after rain
5. Jadwin Reservoir was deleted because it is a dry dam that is only impounded after rain
6. Candy Lake Reservoir was deleted because it was never built according to USACE records
7. Hulah Lake, Lake Barkley, and Lake Shelbyville had extra disconnected fragments that were deleted
8. Southern disconnected portion of Lake Merrisach was deleted
9. Lake Merrisach, Arkansas River Pool 2, and Arkansas Post Canal Reservoir were merged into a single record because they appeared to be entirely connected
10. The section of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir between Robert S. Kerr Lock and Dam and W.D. Mayo Lock and Dam was deleted
11. Arkansas River Pool 13 was combined with the portion of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir that stretches upstream to W.D. Mayo Lock and Dam
12. 50 reservoirs were removed because they were dry according to USACE record (Dry=Yes in attribute table)



HARDNESS AND pH COLUMNS:

1. Water hardness and pH data were interpolated for the conterminous US by the EPA and was obtained at: https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=ec9fe618d7e74c5ca68667b1c8d6e9bc and https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=bdc5b9ca9bfc454d8af22912ba150035. Data was generated by clipping the shapefile to the extent of the USACE reservoirs shapefile and converting to a raster, then using tabulate area to determine hardness class of each reservoir
2. hardness_range includes the range of hardness values occurring in the reservoir based on the hardness shapefile. If multiple classes occurred in the reservoir, the range was expanded to include all of them



COLUMNS PERC_OPEN_WATER_25MI - PERC_HERBACEOUSWETLAND_50MI:

This data was generated using NLCD land cover for 2021 downloaded from https://www.mrlc.gov/data?f%5B0%5D=category%3ALand%20Cover and USACE reservoir shapefiles.

In ArcGIS Pro, 25 mile and 50 mile buffers were created around each USACE reservoir, and the number of pixels belonging to each land use type was counted for each buffer using the "Tabulate Area" tool. The percent of each buffer representing each land use type was then calculated by dividing the number of pixels of each land use type by the total number of pixels in the buffer. Note that not all percentages add up to 100% because some buffers extended into Canada or the ocean, outside of the coverage of NLCD data (hence, pixels we considered "unclassed" and were excluded from analysis).



SURFICIAL GEOLOGY:

This data was generated using USGS surficial geology data downloaded from https://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/425/ and USACE reservoir shapefiles. In ArcGIS Pro, 25 mile buffers were created around each USACE reservoir, and the number of pixels belonging to each surficial geology type was counted for each buffer using the "Tabulate Area" tool. The percent of each buffer representing each land use type was then calculated by dividing the number of pixels of each land use type by the total number of pixels in the buffer.



CLIMATE DATA:

Climate data was extracted from PRISM 30 year (1990-2020) normal climate data, which was downloaded using the prism R package. For information on PRISM data see https://prism.oregonstate.edu/.

to produce this data, the center point of each reservior was found. Using this center point, values for "ppt" (precipitation), "tmean" (mean temperature), "tmin" (min temperature), "tmax" (max temperature), "tdmean" (mean dew point temp) "vpdmin" (minimum vapor deficit), and "vpdmax" (max vapor deficit) were extracted from the PRISM 30 year (1990-2020) year normal 800m resolution raster cells. These data were then condensed into seasonal totals (for precipitaiton), seasonal means (for temperature, dew point-called dewp), seasonal mins (for temperature and vapor pressure deficit --called vpd), and seasonal maxs (for temperature and vapor pressure deficit--called vpd)

temperature is in Celsius, precipitation is in millimeters, and vapor pressure deficit is in hectopascals.

seasons are as follows:
- winter = dec, jan, feb
- spring = mar, apr, may
- summer = jun, jul, aug
- fall = sep, oct, nov



NDCI DATA:

Sentinel-2 data acquisition was done using google earth engine. We used Sentinel 2: Level-2A orthorectified atmospherically corrected surface reflectance from Jan 1st 2023 to Jan 1st 2024. First, the USACE reservoir shapefile was uploaded to google earth engine as an asset. It was then imported and simplified to be accurate within 100m using the simplify function to reduce the complexity of the object. Within each simplified reservoir, we then selected pixels that were classified as water in sentinel-2 L2A's Scene Classification (SCL) image. Water pixels are designated a value of 6. This was done to remove potential clouds, ice, snow, and land pixels from the dataset. Then we calculated the mean of all bands of interest across all water pixels within the simplified reservoir. These values were then exported from google earth engine. 

Then, using R we calculated Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) from Mishra & Mishra 2012. The NDCI output ranges from -1 to 1, smaller values likely have less chlorophyll-a while higher values likely have an increased concentration of chlorophyll-a. Though the NDCI was developed for coastal and estuary waters, it has also been successfully used for North American reservoirs (see Kislik et al., 2022). NDCI was then aggregated into seasonal minimums, means, and maximums for each reservoir.

When using sentinel 2 data, the formula for NDCI is

$(B5 - B4)/(B5 + B4)$

Where B5 is red edge 1 and B4 is red.

seasons are as follows:
- winter = dec, jan, feb
- spring = mar, apr, may
- summer = jun, jul, aug
- fall = sep, oct, nov
